# Linear and non linear data structure

Linear data structure are the one that store values unidirectionally, such that accessing the structure can be accessed linearly. such as an Array, Vector, 1-Dimensional LinkedList, Heap(priority queue), Queue, stack etc.

Wheras non linear data structures are the ones that don't follow a unidirectional approach in storing values they store values in way that may prioritise a certain operation for the datastructure(search, sort, etc). Such as Graphs,Trees(Binary Trees, AVL trees, etc.
